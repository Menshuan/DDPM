Generating images with Hayao Miyazaki's style
For now, this model can generate images but the denoising process is not as good as it suppose to be. The training process is really slow and the Loss function oscillation appear after several epochs.

I'm working on it and trying to solve these problems. Due to my hardware this might take some time but hopefully I could finish it and generate a image with high resolution.
